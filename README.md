This repository showcases a subtle Python bug involving a ZeroDivisionError that arises only when a specific condition is met within a conditional statement.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version demonstrating best practices for handling potential division-by-zero errors. This example highlights the importance of comprehensive testing and error handling in Python development.
